> Be thorough, be honest, but most of all, ask hard questions. Look for specific actions that might prevent such an outage from recurring,
> not just tactically, but also strategically. Ensure that everyone within the company can learn what you have learned by publishing and organizing postmortems."

Morty is a GitHub Action that gives you an overview of your post-mortems. It parses your post-mortems _written in markdown_, and gives you some friendly advice on running good post-mortems on the way ðŸ“ˆ

![morty-example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7828615/95354012-3b833980-08c4-11eb-83c0-845a8523d036.png)

## Getting started

Install the action in a (new) repository. You can create one from a [template repository](https://github.com/mentimeter/example-post-mortems) if you'd like!

To install the action, add a new workflow file `.github/workflows/morty.yml`. It should contain something like this:

```
name: Morty
on:
  # Trigger the workflow on push or pull request,
  # but only for the main branch
  push:
    branches:
      - master
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  morty:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Check that post mortems look good
      uses: mentimeter/morty@v1
      if: ${{ github.event_name == 'pull_request' }}
      run: morty git check
      with:
        token: ${{ github.token }}
    - name: Check post mortems and commit statistics
      uses: mentimeter/morty@v1
      if: ${{ github.event_name == 'push' }}
      run: morty git
      with:
        token: ${{ github.token }}
```

The easiest way to make a new post-mortem is to make a copy of the template that morty makes for you `post-mortems/template.md`.
There are also some more instructions there to help you get going.

## Why morty / post mortems as a repository?

- An incident history you can analyse
- Zero-overhead organization
- Easy to do global search
- Easy to follow normal pull request flow & collaborate
